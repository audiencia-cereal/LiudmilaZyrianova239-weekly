Some information about me!

### More Information

My name is Liudmila Zyrianova and I'm trying to find my place in the world of Computer Technologies. I want to understand whom exactly I want to be: coder or project's architect; and what field of CS to choose: Machine Learning or something connected with Business and Finances. That's why I'm participating in the Open Source project: to develop myself as a coder and as a team player, to contribute in some project, and to get more experience.
