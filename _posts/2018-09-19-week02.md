## September 19th, [Assignment 3](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/cs_ossd/assignments/assignment_03_reading_about_wikipedia.pdf): Wikipedia

By September 19th I've read the article ["Running for office is hard when you have a porn starâ€™s name. This makes it worse"](https://qz.com/1352568/running-for-office-is-hard-when-you-have-a-porn-stars-name-this-makes-it-worse/) and many comments from [the discussion of why the page should be deleted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Catalina_Cruz_(politician)).  As it turns out, this discussion doesn't have one concrete answer for me. 

Firstly,  the reaction to the author's actions is debatable. As far as I'm concerned, she deserves both encouragement and censure. She tries to protect Catalina Cruz, whose future career depends on her reputation and whether the voter can trust and rely on her. But how can they rely on the person, who have such problems with Google's result? As we can see, Cruz is in a desperate situation. She really needs a disambiguation page and her own page on Wikipedia.  Hence, Herzog seems to do a right thing. However, she shouldn't break community rules by outing the other author. So, she's deserved her punishment. 

Secondly, the definition of notability is absolutely fair, and Herzog shouldn't worry too much about her inability to influence Cruz's page. Because if Cruz is indeed a notable person, who deserves a page on Wikipedia, there should be other people, who want to protect Cruz, add her page on Wikipedia, and fill it by reliable links.
Unfortunately, in this case, the notability restriction makes it almost impossible for Cruz to become notable.
