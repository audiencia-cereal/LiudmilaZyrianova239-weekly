By September 5th I've followed the instuctions from `README.md`, changed `_config.yml`, `about.md`, and `README.md` files. 

Also I've edited the map from [OpenStreetMaps](https://www.openstreetmap.org). You can find the histore of my changes [here]( https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/LiudmilaZyrianova239/history).

* Added restaurants such as Flinders Lane, bartaco, Buffalo Wild Wings, Barcelona, Kotobuki, and McDonald's.
