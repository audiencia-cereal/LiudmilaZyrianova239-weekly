## September 26th, [Assignment 5](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/cs_ossd/assignments/assignment_05_git_workflow.pdf): A Git Workfow Assignment

It was a very useful assignment because it was my first meaningful usage of Git:
* There were some applications of necessary commands, and it helped to understand the material from the book better.
* I've also understood some features of GitHub better.

However, I've got confused that the `sources` is the same as `src`, so initially, I've created a new directory 'source\', added a .cpp file there, and pushed these changes to GitHub. And when I realized my mistake, I've changed everything.
